The Core Interpreter works with the following logic:
    1. Tokenizes the Core Program
    2. Parses Core program
    3. Pretty Prints the Core Program following the indentation style that exists in Python
    4. Executes the Core Program

Note: The Core Interpreter will read from an additional file if there are any "read" statements with the code

Testing:
    The Interpreter was tested using several test Core files as well as test data files.
    For the test files, I found what the expected output should be and compared it to 
    what the Interpreter outputted into the console.
